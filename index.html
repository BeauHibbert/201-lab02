        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
        <p>I am 26 years old from Seattle, Washington. I attended Washington State University to pursue a degree in economics before enrolling in Code Fellows. Previous to this I worked in the banking industry as a teller. I decided that the banking industry wasn't for me and decided that I needed to go back to school. I was going to enroll back at WSU but it would have taken me three more years to get a degree in software engineering. Luckily, my girlfriend went through Code Fellows a couple years ago and after finding out I could get the same education in a fraction of the time, it was a no brainer to enroll in Code Fellows instead.</p>
